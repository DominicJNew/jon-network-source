# Source for Jon's Network

The entire Django source code for https://jon.network

I felt wrong not making it open source.

Good luck if you try and read it hehe................

Small breakdown of the code:

```
File          - What it is           - URL (If any)
----------------------------------------------------------
backend/      - Settings
templates/    - all the HTML files
shop/         - Programming Articles - /programming-articles/
chat/         - DevChat              - /chat/
forum/        - 4um                  - /forum/
links/        - Link sharing         - /links/
scriptlytics/ - ScriptLytics         - /scriptlytics/
users/        - Users
accounts/     - Other User Stuff??
devkit/       - Page view counter
```

Any folder not mentioned is useless, I just didn't delete the folder because... well... i dunno!
